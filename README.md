# Finding a Career Path - Project 7
Project 7 (aka task 3)
This project includes a multistep task in the P7 file. P7 code includes the code for our results pages. The first of these pages will be called result.html. This page acts as a summary of a participant's results based on the number of times he/she has taken the quiz in the past. This will be hard coded. From this page, users will be able to see more detail on click of the results photo. On click, the user will be taken to resDetail.html. This page will show the results in a more detailed fashion, including links and articles, recruitment help, and possible major opportunities. 

Updated Project 6 (task 1)
We also updated code in P6 file. This includes updates that user testing brough up last week: hiding password text, creating better restrictions that show error messages when information is not filled in/filled in properly, and direct and immediate feedback saying the registration is complete at the end of the second page (creation of user profile). Overall, we also updated the styling and color profile of this task. Making it consistent with the formatting and styling we started using in Project 7 for task 3.
